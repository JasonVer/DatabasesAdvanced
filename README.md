<h1> Web scraping python script </h1>

<h2> Intro </h2>
The website we used to scrape: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/unconfirmed-transactions <br>
The script will put the scraped variables in two log files, highest.log and all.log <br>

<h2> Requirements </h2>
You need to run python to make use of this script. <br>
If you don't have python installed on your computer, you can simply install python with the help of a youtube tutorial. <br>
I do reccomend to use the latest version of Python (3.9.0). <br>
You need to install pandas and bs4, otherwise the script won't run. <br>
You can do so simply by using following lines: <br>
<ul>
  <li> pip install pandas </li>
  <li> pip install bs4 </li>
</ul>

If you are on a Ubuntu OS you can use the command git clone to download this repository. <br>
<ul>
  <li> link to clone the git: https://github.com/JasonVer/DatabasesAdvanced.git </li>
</ul>
To execute the script use: python3 scraper.py <br>
